# A-Level-NEA
## What is this?
This was the private repository that I used for my A-Level Non-Exam Assessment for Computer Science. I haven't touched this in ages, and I don't plan to exactly spend all my time working on this. Some of the code is really bad, but I somehow got an **A**. Go figure. I can finally make this public as my grades have been finalised and I have certificates.
## What is inside?
A strange collection of parts for a Doom-style engine, written in pure Rust. I never got round to making the actual game, that is tangible and has graphics, but I sure can divide lines based on some old standard of map compilation. I think it probably works, because I have a map editor which is really rubbish and it compiles, saves, then re-opens and looks the same. I assume that's good. 
## Will this work on my Blackberry Curve 9330?
I mean, you can *try*.
## Will this save my marriage?
30% success rate.
